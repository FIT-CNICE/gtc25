The “Next AI Opportunities in China” note indicates that Chinese companies have unique advantages including hardware-enhanced AI, supply chain integration, and specialized AI applications.\nThese trends create opportunities for interconnect manufacturers who can meet the specific requirements of Chinese AI companies while navigating the complex regulatory environment.\nFocus on Cost-Effectiveness\nWhile early AI infrastructure focused primarily on performance, the notes indicate a shift toward cost-effectiveness and operational efficiency. ByteDance’s approach emphasizes “price-performance ratio” in network architecture decisions, and several sources mention the importance of reducing inference costs.\nThis trend highlights the importance of delivering high-performance interconnects at competitive price points, leveraging our manufacturing efficiency to maintain margins while meeting cost targets.\nSpecialized vs. General-Purpose Networking\n\n\n\nEast-West fabric architecture showing the critical importance of GPU cluster interconnects\n\n\nThe industry is debating the merits of specialized networks (like InfiniBand) versus enhanced general-purpose networks (like Spectrum-X Ethernet). Scaleway’s experience, detailed in “Bridging Performance and Flexibility in Network Architecture,” shows the advantages of Ethernet-based approaches including leveraging existing expertise, better multi-tenancy support, and dynamic cluster control.\nFor interconnect manufacturers, this debate creates opportunities to develop products that address both specialized and general-purpose networking needs, leveraging our expertise in high-precision manufacturing to deliver superior performance regardless of the chosen protocol.\nConvergence of AI and Edge Computing\nThe expansion of AI into robotics, autonomous vehicles, and industrial applications is creating new demand for high-performance interconnects in edge environments. Unlike data center deployments, these applications often face space, weight, power, and environmental constraints that require specialized interconnect solutions.\nOur experience with miniaturization and precision manufacturing positions us well to develop compact, reliable interconnects for these emerging applications, opening new markets beyond traditional data centers."
