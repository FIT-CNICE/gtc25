### Strategic Opportunities for Interconnect Manufacturers

Based on the identified trends, we see five key strategic opportunities for interconnect manufacturers:

1. **PCIe 6.0/7.0 Leadership**

   Our recent demonstrations of PCIe 6.0 and 7.0 capabilities position us at the forefront of a critical technology transition. The notes indicate that PCIe is evolving to address the needs of disaggregated computing resources within data centers, creating opportunities for direct-attach cabling solutions like our CDFP and OSFP-XD connectors and cables.
   
   Our partnership with Alphawave Semi demonstrates the market's need for complete ecosystem solutions that deliver unmatched performance at the lowest power and lowest latency.

2. **Specialization for AI Workloads**

   The unique communication patterns of AI workloads create opportunities for specialized interconnect designs. While general-purpose connectors may achieve the raw bandwidth requirements, connectors optimized for the bursty, high-utilization patterns of AI computing will deliver superior performance.
   
   Our expertise in high-precision manufacturing allows us to develop connectors with tighter tolerances, better signal integrity, and improved thermal characteristics - all critical for the demanding environment of AI computing clusters.

3. **Domain-Optimized Interconnect Solutions**

   The diverse requirements of AI factories, industrial robotics, and autonomous vehicles demand specialized interconnect solutions tailored to their unique operating environments:
   
   - **AI Factory Interconnects**: High-density, thermally efficient designs with advanced signal integrity features for the extreme scale of AI training environments. Our CDFP and OSFP-XD form factors can be adapted for these high-bandwidth, high-density applications.
   
   - **Industrial Robotics Connectors**: Ruggedized, EMI-shielded designs with deterministic performance characteristics for factory environments. Our precision manufacturing capabilities can be applied to develop connectors that withstand vibration, thermal cycling, and harsh industrial conditions.
